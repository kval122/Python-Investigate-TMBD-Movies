# TMDB Movie Exploration with Python

This project delves into the fascinating world of movies using data from The Movie Database (TMDB). We'll leverage the power of Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights into movie runtime, average vote, and release year relationships.

**Key Questions:**

* Does movie runtime impact the average vote?
* How has movie runtime evolved over time?
* How has average vote changed throughout the years?

**Data:**

* Source: Udacity 
* Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the TMDB movie data (CSV file)
* `notebooks/`: Houses Jupyter Notebook files for analysis and visualizations

**Dependencies:**

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
