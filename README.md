# Python-Investigate-TMBD-Movies
This project will involve an in-depth analysis of data describing 100k movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDB).

In this analysis we are focusing on the relationship between average vote, movie runtime and release year.

The questions we would like to know about this data are:

Does the runtime of the movie have an effect on the vote average?

How has movie runtime changed over the years?

How has vote average changed over the years?
